High-Level Summary:

We are making a space tour app where people can plan and schedule their space tour on the nearest planets. There will be several choice and space tour service providers. Also, people can share their experiences and know about others. The app also features space exploration sections. People can see photos and observe some planets or objects and other information about the planets, which is not currently in travel situations.  The app also features other exciting features like weight calculation on different planets, size and distance calculation of different planets, and so on. We use our data from some NASA APIs like NASA image API,  and other verified sources.
